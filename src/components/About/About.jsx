          <p>
            I'm a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in software engineering, IT systems, and problem-solving. I enjoy working at the intersection of technology and practical impact—building, maintaining, and improving systems that people rely on every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through my academic projects and hands-on experience, I've developed a solid foundation in programming, debugging, system troubleshooting, and collaborative development. I'm comfortable learning new tools quickly and adapting to new environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently on OPT and seeking opportunities where I can contribute, grow professionally, and build long-term value for a team.
